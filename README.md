# Texas Grid Load Tracker

</div>

A web app and dashboard that collected and displayed ERCOT load and available power over the [2021 Texas power crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Texas_power_crisis).

The dashboard is still up, but the collector has been shut down to reduce Github Actions usage.

Edit (04/14/2021): The collector is up to track ongoing supply shortages in the ERCOT system.
